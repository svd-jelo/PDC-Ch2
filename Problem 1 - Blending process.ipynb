    "## Example 1 - Blending Process\n",
    "\n",
    "A stirred-tank blending process with a constant liquid hold up of $2~\\text{m}^3$ is used to blend two streams whose densities are both approximately $900~\\text{kg/m}^3$. The density does not change during mixing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assume that the process has been operating for a long period of time with flow rates of $w_1 = 500~\\text{kg/min}$ and $w_2 = 200~\\text{kg/min},$ and feed compositions (mass fraction) of $x_1 = 0.4$ and $x_2 = 0.75.$ What is the steady-state value of $x.$\n",
    "2. Suppose that $w_1$ changes suddenly from $500$ to $400~\\text{kg/min}$ and remains at the new value. Determine an expression for $x(t)$ and plot it.\n",
    "3. Repeat part 2 for the case where $w_2$ (insead of $w_1$ ) changes suddenly from $200$ to $100~\\text{kg/min}$ and remains there.\n",
    "4. Repeat part 3 for the case where $x_1$ suddenly changes from $0.4$ to $0.6$ (in addition to the change in $w_2$ ).\n",
    "5. For parts 2 through 4, plot the normalized response $x_N(t),$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_N(t) = \\frac{x(t)-x(0)}{x(\\infty)-x(0)}$$\n",

    "## Solution to Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Systematic Approach for Developing Dynamic Models\" will be followed, but some parts of it will be omitted: the degrees of freedom of analysis will be omitted since I have not learned that yet; inputs will not be classified as disturbance variables or as manipulated variables since these info will not be needed to solve the problem.\n",

    "- To determine the steady-state value of $x.$ This steady-state value is denoted as $x(\\infty)$\n",

    "\n",
    "The only necessary conservation equation to be set up is the solute balance. The following derivation gives the general model; all variables are time-dependent. Special cases of the model will be used for parts 2 through 4. For instance, in part 2 all but the two variables $x, w_1$ are time-dependent, and $w_1$ is defined by a formula involving the Heaviside function $u(t-a)$.\n",
