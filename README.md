# Chapter 2 - Theoretical Models of Chemical Processes
## Problem 1 - Blending Process
A stirred-tank blending process with a constant liquid hold up of $2~\text{m}^3$ is used to blend two streams whose densities are both approximately $900~\text{kg/m}^3$. The density does not change during mixing.<br/>
- Assume that the process has been operating for a long period of time with flow rates of $w_1 = 500~\text{kg/min}$ and $w_2 = 200~\text{kg/min}$, and feed compositions (mass fraction) of $x_1 = 0.4$ and $x_2 = 0.75$. What is the steady-state value of $x$.
- Suppose that $w_1$ changes suddenly from $500$ to $400~\text{kg/min}$ and remains at the new value. Determine an expression for $x(t)$ and plot it.
- Repeat part 2 for the case where $w_2$ (insead of $w_1$) changes suddenly from $200$ to $100~\text{kg/min}$ and remains there.
- Repeat part 3 for the case where $x_1$ suddenly changes from $0.4$ to $0.6$ (in addition to the change in $w_2$).
- For parts 2 through 4, plot the normalized response $x_N(t)$,
$$x_N(t) = \frac{x(t)-x(0)}{x(\infty)-x(0)}$$
